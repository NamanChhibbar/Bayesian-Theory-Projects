\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

We proved the following in our analysis:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The conjugate prior for the normal mean is normal
  \item The posterior mean is the weighted average of prior and likelihood mean
  \item The posterior precision is the sum of prior and likelihood precision
  \item The posterior distribution is influenced more by the data (likelihood) as the data size increases.
\end{itemize}
