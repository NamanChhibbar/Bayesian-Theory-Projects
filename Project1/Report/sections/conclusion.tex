\section{Conclusion}

We proved that the conjugate prior for the normal mean is normal, the posterior mean is the weighted average of prior and likelihood mean, and the posterior precision is the sum of prior and likelihood precision.

Our analysis shows that the posterior distribution is influenced more by the data (likelihood) as the data size increases.
