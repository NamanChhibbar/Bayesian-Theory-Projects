\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Interpretation of Results}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our analysis reveals key trends in the product sales across multiple months.
    \item Analyzing posterior metrics allows us to draw insights into:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consistency: Whether the product maintains similar sales each year.
        \item Performance Shifts: Any significant changes in sale across seasons.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Bayesian analysis provides a flexible framework for tracking and updating these insights time by time.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Conclusion}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item This project demonstrates the power of Bayesian analysis in analyzing product sales.
    \item By continuously updating our belief about revenue generated, we achieve a dynamic understanding of the product sales.
    \item This approach can be extended to other applications where other things are updated as more data becomes available.
  \end{itemize}
