  \begin{itemize}

    \item We are using Monthly Sales Data of sell of electronics equipment across USA in 2019.
    \item This data is pre-processed in our required format.
    \item After pre-processing our each entry in the dataset is recording the total revenue generated from that product in the given month.
    \item This data allows us to model mean revenue as a Normal distribution with variance known and apply Bayesian updating over time.
    \item For simplicity purpose, we assumed data variance as prior variance.
