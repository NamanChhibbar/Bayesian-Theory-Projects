\begin{frame}{Dataset Overview}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item We are using monthly sales data of electronics equipment across the USA in 2019.
    \item This data is pre-processed in our required format.
    \item After pre-processing, each entry in the dataset records the total revenue generated from that product in the given month.
    \item This allows us to model the mean revenue as a normal distribution with known variance and apply normal-normal Bayesian analysis updating over time.
  \end{itemize}
