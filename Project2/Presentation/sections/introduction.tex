  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bayesian analysis provides a method for updating beliefs based on new evidence.
    \item We start with a prior belief, gather data (likelihood), and compute a posterior distribution to represent our updated belief.
    \item The Normal-Normal conjugate relationship allows us to efficiently update our revenue estimates, making it ideal for analyzing a product's sale and revenue generated over time.
