\begin{frame}{Objective of the Project}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our goal is to track the revenue generated from a product from its sale over multiple months, using sales data from each month to continuously refine our estimate of revenue generated from that product.
    \item We use a Bayesian approach to incorporate prior knowledge, allowing us to interpret revenue in each new month in light of past performances.
  \end{itemize}
