\section{Initial Setup - Choosing a Prior}

\begin{frame}{Initial Setup - Choosing a Prior}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item We start with a flat prior for the teamâ€™s win probability in Year 1, representing no initial assumptions about their performance.
    \item This prior is expressed as a Beta(1, 1) distribution, assigning equal probability to all win rates between 0 and 1.
  \end{itemize}
