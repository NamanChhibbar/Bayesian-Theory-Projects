\section{Interpretation of Results}

Our analysis reveals key trends in the team’s performance across multiple seasons.
Analyzing posterior metrics allows us to draw insights into:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistency: Whether the team maintains similar win rates each year.
  \item Performance Shifts: Any significant changes in win probability across seasons.
\end{itemize}

Bayesian analysis provides a flexible framework for tracking and updating these insights year by year.

\section{Conclusion}

This project demonstrates the power of Bayesian analysis in analyzing team performance.
By continuously updating our belief about win probability, we achieve a dynamic understanding of the team’s performance.
This approach can be extended to other applications where probabilities are updated as more data becomes available.
