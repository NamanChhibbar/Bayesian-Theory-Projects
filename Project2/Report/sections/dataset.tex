\section{About Dataset}

We are using Monthly Sales Data of sell of electronics equipment across USA in 2019.
This data is pre-processed in our required format.
After pre-processing our each entry in the dataset is recording the total revenue generated from that product in the given month.
This data allows us to model mean revenue as a Normal distribution with variance known and apply Bayesian updating over time.
