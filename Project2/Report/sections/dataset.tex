\section{About Dataset}

We use the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set from Kaggle found \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data}{here}.
The dataset contains 569 rows with 33 attributes. Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.
They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

The attribute we analyze is \textit{perimeter\_mean}, which is the mean size of the core tumour.
Refer to \autoref{fig:hist} for the histogram of this attribute.
